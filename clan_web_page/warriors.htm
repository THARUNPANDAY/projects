<center><strong><div><p id="tit"> Welcome to Clash of Clans THE WARRIORZ!!!</p></strong></center>
<p id="pc">This clan group is based on the concept of war farming / war sniping, i.e.: asking the enemy to put their top 2 TH's and 9 storages in a corner for us to snipe for the 30% war winners loot bonus.</p>
<hr>
<strong><p id="red">MESSAGE TO ENEMY CLAN:</p></strong>
<p>If you're our enemy, we would like to make a deal. If you put your top 2 TH's &amp; 9 storages out of range of your defenses, every one of our members will attack only them. If you accept, in return we will help you by:</p>
<ol>
<li>Attacking only your top 2 exposed TH's. Also, we'll use up our attacks early in the war so that you will have the confidence that you will win and feel safe sniping us back </li>
<li>Leave our clan castles empty</li>
<li>Leave our bases defenseless &amp; as easy to destroy/loot as possible. </li>
</ol>
<p>You'll get to choose between earning lots of stars, XP, loot, or a combination of each. In the war the top scoring enemy players earned 834K gold/elixir and 3600 DE, and they got it all with just a few archer snipers.</p>
<p>What's in it for us? We get the 30% loot bonus that goes to the losers. When combined with the easy loot in your 9 storages, it's a good deal for us, and a win-win for both clans. </p>
<p>Feel free to send someone over to our clan on preparation day to chat, verify that our cc's are empty, check the location of our traps, and review our war log &amp; previous attacks to see that we always war like this. We have nothing to hide and can answer any questions you might have.</p>

<h3 id="red">Clan Family Rules:</h3>
<p>The THE WARRIORZ!!! group of clans is based on the idea of War Farming and is setup to be relatively open to all clashers. We sync the start of our wars with each other every ~50 hours. Main clans &quot;THE WARRIORZ!!!&quot; accept all TH5+ players.If you wish to join please read the war description fully. </p>
<hr>
<p><strong id="red">General Rules:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The clan family is formed for loot wars (war sniping/farming). No competitive wars. </li>
<li>Clans cap at 49</li>
<li>No excessive profanity or hostility in the clan chat. Keep it classy. Be kind to one another at all times.</li>
<li>The rules are meant to be changed as required over time, but until the rules are changed, all members, elders, co&#39;s and leaders must follow the rules. The rules protect everyone.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><strong id="red">Donations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In the last 15 days of the season, if the clan is at 49 members; any one member with less than 200 donations &amp; requests and no attacks in the last 2 wars may be soft kicked (invite back after kicking) and re-directed to the newest THE WARRIORZ!!! clan</li>
<li>Any member who does donate only a few troops after requesting and receiving many troops may be removed at a co&#39;s discretion</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><strong id="red">War Bases:</strong></p>
<p>All war bases must comply with the following principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Buildings &amp; air defenses separated</li>
<li>ground only defenses separated (x-bows set to ground)</li>
<li>multi (air/ground) defenses separated (including teslas)</li>
<li>traps walled off</li>
</ul>
<p>Feel free to have fun with your war base with creative messages or design, but make sure it conforms to the above principles. See this page for many examples of acceptable bases: <a href="http://www.tr.im/bases" rel="nofollow">tr.im/bases</a></p>
<hr>
<p><strong id="red">War Rules:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>No troops in war CC&#39;s</li>
<li>If the enemy does not comply by exposing their TH &amp; storages, within 1-hour of the start of war day you can optionally change your war base to a defensive layout. War base layout should be immediately be changed back to an easy base on war day before your use your war attacks so that it is ready for the next war. Failure to change back to an easy base the next prep day could cause major problems for the clan and get it kicked from LWF.</li>
<li>There are 4 scenarios of how the war could go:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>When the matchup is against a war clan that does not expose TH&#39;s or Storages, use your attacks in any way you wish. Recommended is to barch/loonion the highest base you feel you can 1-star in order to take the war loot bonus! Members are encouraged to spread their attacks around to earn extra XP, but this is not required. </li>
<li>When the matchup is against a war clan that does expose 2 or more TH&#39;s and Storages, attack the two bases for loot. Attack as early as possible. </li>
<li>When the matchup is against a farm clan that wants/gets to loose, attack your mirror and get 3 stars with your first attack, and attack #1 with your second attack</li>
<li>When the matchup is against a farm clan that wants/gets to win, attack your mirror and get 2 stars with your first attack, and attack #1 with your second attack</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p id="red"><strong id="red">Best Practices:</strong> (It&#39;s nice if you do these, but you don&#39;t have to)</p>
<ul>
<li> Donate whatever is requested else get booted..Avoid making specific requests so everyone can donate to you. If someone requests &quot;any&quot;, don&#39;t donate wallbreakers, goblins, etc unless specifically requested</li>
<li>Donate &amp; request at least 400 per season</li>
<li>If you can&#39;t be available to attack for an extended period, consider joining our feeder clan or vacationing clan &quot;Retired 701&quot;</li>
<li>Excessive clan hopping is frowned upon and discouraged</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><strong id="red">Elder Qualifications:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Have a 3-star rated base. See examples here: <a href="http://www.tr.im/lootbases" rel="nofollow">tr.im/lootbases</a></li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><strong id="red">Co-Leader Qualifications:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fullfill the leadership responsibilities below</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><strong id="red">Leadership Responsibilities:</strong></p>
<p>All clans should have at least 5 co-leaders. To become eligible to be a co-leader, you must fulfill a combination of the following responsibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be available to initiate wars at designated sync times</li>
<li>Welcome new members, confirm they understand the war farming concept, and ask them to change their war base to a farming base ASAP.</li>
<li>A clan mail should be sent at the beginning of prep day notifying all the players that do not have a perfect base. </li>
<li>Kicking members: generally, only kick members when the clan is at 49 members and kick only one at a time so that the clan is always comfortably above 45 members. Kick as a last resort. Consider demoting rule breakers or sitting them out of a future war until they give their word they will follow the rules. </li>
<li>Go to the other clan and attempt to negotiate as required</li>
<li>Be a top active player with high request/donation totals every season</li>
<li>Promote new co-leaders if required with the above characteristics to make sure wars are started at the sync time</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><strong id="red">Rules for Co-leaders / Elders:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>All potential elders/co-leaders must indicate that they&#39;ve read and understand these rules before being promoted. </li>
<li>Only accept new members that agree to make their bases easily 3-starable.</li>
<li>After a clan reaches 49 members, accept new members only to re-direct them to another THE WARRIORZ!!! clan. The new member should be kicked shortly thereafter</li>
<li>Start wars only at the designated sync time, only 45v45. If a sync is missed, a new war may not be started until the next sync. </li>
<li>If the clan has more than 45 players, sit out whoever was on the bottom in the previous war (see war map), are inactive, a bad donator, or did not attack properly in the previous war.</li>
<li>If the clan is not 45v45 at the war sync time, open up the clan to get a random person to join so the war can be started. Random players should immediately agree to change their war base or be kicked.</li>
<li>If anyone has to be kicked for any reason, communicate the reason they were kicked in the clan chat so that everyone understands why the kick was necessary.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><strong id="red">New Clan Creation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>When all clans reach at least 45 members, a new clan will be created to accept additional members</li>
<li>Try to maintain at least 4 TH10&#39;s in every clan to maximize the loot for everyone!</li>
</ul>
